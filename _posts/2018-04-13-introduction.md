# Summary

After many years of learning and building "home baked" projects, I finally decided to start capturing my lessons learned and resulting software products in a more controlled and sustainable environment under the banner of "Wamsware".  Wamsware is essentially an intentionally perpetual work in progress emphasizing quality and maximum community benefit without the typical time, budget and resource constraints that typically characterize corporate software projects.

# About Me

A few years ago ... ok, more than a few ... I began what I like to think of as a technological journey which essentially began when my parents purchased a TI-99 computer system for my brother and I.  I remember playing simple games like Pong and Space Invaders, but the TI-99 computer was more than just a game system.  It provided the ability to actually write computer programs in an early version of the BASIC language. Soon after that, I wrote my first BASIC program marking my first "hello world" software excursion.  Moving into some Fortran on a Radio Shack TRS-80, thanks to what was an advanced class offered at my high school, the seeds of procedural programming were etched into my young brain providing a foundation that still remains (with a few patches and modifications along the way).  Somethere between that Fortran course and High School graduation, I was exposed to personal computers running Apple and Microsoft operating systems.  I clearly remember thinking how awsome the splash screen was as the machine slowly booted up and launched the graphical user interface, feeling like I had no idea what to do since there was no obvious window in which I could type a command.  By the time I entered my freshman year in college, pursing a B.S. in Electrical Engineering at Widener University, schools had full computer networks and personal computer labs (where I spent much of my time as a lab assistent). After graduating from college and starting my first job in the engineering field, I continued to stay involved with software developement as applied to engineering applications.  Software was always kind of a means to an end for me, since I identified myself as an Electrical Engineer simply building software as a tool for providing engineering solutions.  Eventually, software developement became more central in my professional identity and eventually I began to identify myself as a "Software Engineer", evenually transitioning completely to "Software Developer".  

# The Purpose of Wamsware

After about 25 years in the defense and aerospace industry, I thought I was a relativley good software developer.  I had experience in multiple languges lke Fortran, C++, Java and C-Sharp in Linux and Windows.  I had been a tech lead on multiple projects and also had experience with testing, design and systems engineering.  With all of this experience, I thought I was positioned well in my career as a Software Developer.  But, I was wrong.  As I started to look for new opportunities, I realized that the questions I was being asked were very specific and focused on new products and technologies that I had little or no familiarity with.  Ironically, I was doing very well at my current position, leading software teams using technologies that I was intimately familiar with.  On the other hand, my ability to learn new technologies was diminishing for two main reasons:  1) The technology curve was exponentially diverging from my knowledge base; 2) I was spending all of my career developement focused time and energy at work.  The realization slowly set in that all I had was a foundation, and there was a lot more that I needed to learn before I could venture forth into the wild as a viable developer.  That is why I started Wamsware.  I needed something to help me grow and learn, and share this with others in the process.
